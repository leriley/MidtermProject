I started drawing at the age of 13 years old. At the age of 14, I started developing an idea for a story which became the comic I'm working on today. Here's a couple of small page samples!

### Characters
* **Annabel Lee Carter:** A girl obsessed with the paranormal and dedicated to uncovering the cause for "the Harvest," an annual series of disappearances in her hometown. Her mother was a Harvest victim when Annabel was five years old.
* **Sydney 'Syd' LaRoe:** Annabel's best friend. Fearless and full of angst, he's the only other kid in town willing to listen to Annabel Lee. He likes snakes and guitars but hates his mom. 
* **Roxie Lane:** Although highly recognizable due to the unqiue markings on her skin and the white streaks in her hair, not much is known about her. She doesn't go to school in town. No one knowns where she lives or has ever heard her speak.
* **Elliott Carter:** Annabel's older brother as well as her legal guardian. The last thing he wants to do is think about the Harvest. Unfortunately, his sister's shenanigans keep him in a constant state of worry. He never quite recovered from the loss of their mother. He wanted to go to culinary school but he was unable to follow his dreams after their father left.
