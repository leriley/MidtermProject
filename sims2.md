## Corruption in *The Sims 2* is Largely Exaggerated and Misunderstood
### Here is an FAQ about myths and misconceptions regarding *Sims 2* corruption:

**Will deleting a Sim from the neighborhood bin cause corruption?**  
Nope. The original rumour supposedly spread after people misunderstood one of Pescado's rants about stub character files. It has been proven by Lazyduchess, among other known modders, that deleting sims from the household bin in neighborhood view is perfectly safe and will only shred their character file down to essential information, preserving memories and family trees.

**Will moving an occupied house to the bin cause corruption?**  
Same situation as above. Your sim might drag a couple of other stub character files along for the ride, though.

**Will having my Sim in the SavedSims folder as a Bodyshop export cause corruption?**  
No. In addition to this, it is pointless to clone an extracted Sim in bodyshop and delete the original. This practice was only necessary with older versions of simPE. With up-to-date installs, the original extracted Sim file and the cloned one will be identical.

**Will deleting my Sim with move objects cause corruption?**  
Here's a fun fact about *The Sims 2*: Everything is an object. Sims, however, are not universal and hence only spawn as instances of themselves on your lot. Deleting a single instance is perfectly fine--you can just go back to the neighborhood screen, reload the lot, and you're all good.

**Will saving and leaving with my sim on the phone cause corruption?**  
Only if you're planning to install a global mod (marked accordingly by the creator) or a new EP. These days, I doubt you're going to.

**Will deleting a Maxis neighborhood cause corruption?**  
If it's a main hood in your Neighborhoods folder, no.

**Will running Hoodchecker cause corruption?**  
**No.** Hoodchecker is an essential anti-corruption tool. The only annoying thing it does is remove premade events from the Maxis BG neighborhoods. Solution: don't run it until after you've finished the scripted events. No corruption caused either way.

**Will moving in service NPCs like bartenders or burglars or matchmakers corrupt my 'hood?**  
Nope. They're service NPCs, not global NPCs. There's a reason why you can form relationships with them, invite them over, and--eventually--move them in. Otherwise, I think any Pleasantview with Kaylynn Langerak as a playable would be long corrupted.

**Will letting the Ottomas twins be born corrupt my game?**  
The reason this came around was a known bug with subhoods, where pregnant sims added via subhoods would give birth to babies whose other parent was randomised. However, premade pregnancies like the Ottomas or Crittur babies were patched years ago. If you have the Ultimate Collection in any form (even the misleading Mr DJ version), you're all good.

The same cannot be said for subhoods of custom hoods, though! Even clean ones. Pascal's baby could have the Therapist for a father if you add Strangetown as a subhood. Make sure to run Hoodchecker after you add any new subhood!

**Will cleaning up a smashed urnstone corrupt my game?**  
For some clarification, it's akin to deleting a grave manually. Which, as mentioned above, is harmless. So, nope.

### How to avoid corruption

1. Make sure your object.package files are set to READ ONLY
2. Download the nounlinkondelete mod - http://www.moreawesomethanyou.com/smf/index.php?topic=2083.0
3. Use Clean Templates of Maxis neighbourhoods by MeetMeToTheRiver. Although MeetMe has stated these are not 'less corrupt' than the vanilla Maxis 'hoods, they do fix oversights and bugs, such as Lola and Chloe not recognizing the Curious brothers as family - https://meetmetotheriver.tumblr.com/tagged/clean%20templates
4. Use Sims2Pack Clean Installer when installing .sims2pack files - https://modthesims.info/d/409950/sims2pack-clean-installer-v1-6-22-updated-aug-2-2014.html
